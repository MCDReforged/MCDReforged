Next Steps
==========

Now, you've got the basic knowledge of MCDR. What's next?

Plugins
-------

MCDR is kind of a plugin-based framework. You may want to:

* Take a look at the `Plugin Catalogue <https://mcdreforged.com/en/plugins>`__ to find some interesting plugins
* Use :ref:`\!!MCDR plg <command/mcdr:Plugin management>` to search and install plugins with their dependencies

If you have interest to develop one yourself:

* :doc:`Create your own plugin </plugin_dev/basic>`, and :doc:`publish it into the catalogue </plugin_dev/plugin_catalogue>`
* We have official `Example Plugin <https://github.com/MCDReforged/ExamplePlugin>`__ and `Plugin Template <https://github.com/MCDReforged/PluginTemplate>`__ for you to start with
* :doc:`/code_references/index` may help you to understand the interfaces of MCDR
* Check out the source code of popular plugins, even MCDR itself, to learn more

Commands
--------

MCDR has its own command system.  Most of them start with a ``!!`` in common practice. Mentioned above, ``!!MCDR plg`` is one of the built-in commands.

You may want to learn more of them: :doc:`/command/index`

Permission
----------

MCDR has a permission system to control the access of commands. For example, most ``!!MCDR`` commands are only accessible for level 3 (Admin) users.

Currently the permission system is quite simple, but it's enough for most cases.

More details in: :doc:`/permission`

CLI
---

MCDR has a Command Line Interface to provide some useful tools for you. For example, you may manage plugins without launching the server

More details in: :doc:`/cli/index`

Community
---------

We have an organization on Github that hosts the source code for most parts of the MCDR project

Check it out: `MCDReforged@Github <https://github.com/MCDReforged>`__

Migrate
-------

If you were a user of legacy versions of MCDR, you may want to check out the :doc:`/migrate/index`

Have fun with MCDR!
