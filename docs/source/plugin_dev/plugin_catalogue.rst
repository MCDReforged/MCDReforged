Plugin Catalogue
================

The official MCDR plugin catalogue is the ``master`` branch of repository https://github.com/MCDReforged/PluginCatalogue. Users can browse plugins here and developers can submit their plugins to the catalogue

The catalogue is updated once files change, and twice per hour via github action

File structures
---------------

Plugin information is stored in the ``plugins/`` directory in the repository. Each plugin has its own sub-directory named by its plugin id inside the ``plugins/`` directory

.. code-block::

    plugins/
     ├─ my_plugin
     │   └─ plugin_info.json
     └─ another_plugin
         ├─ plugin_info.json
         └─ some_other_files.txt

Plugin Info
^^^^^^^^^^^

``plugin_info.json`` contains the basic information of your plugin

id
~~

The id of your plugin. It needs to be the same with the name of the directory the ``plugin_info.json`` is in

Type: str

authors
~~~~~~~

Optional field, default: ``[]``

A list contains the authors of the plugin. Elements in the list can be a single str representing the name of the author, or a dict contains the author name and the url link of the author

Example:

.. code-block:: json

    "authors": [
        "Someone",
        "That person",
        {
            "name": "AnotherOne",
            "link": "https://github.com/AnotherOne"
        },
        {
            "name": "MyFriend",
            "link": "https://www.myfriend.com"
        }
    ]

Type: List[str or dict]

repository
~~~~~~~~~~

The url of the **github** repository of your plugin

Type: str

branch
~~~~~~

The branch of the git repository where your plugin is in

Type: str

related_path
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Optional field, default: ``"."``, which means your plugin files are in the root directory of your repository

The related path of your plugin files in your repository

This is the root directory for plugin catalogue to fetch files from your repository. A ``mcdreforged.plugin.json`` metadata file is expected in this directory

For example, if your plugin repository has following file structure

.. code-block::

    source/
        my_plugin/
            __init__.py
        doc/
            introduction.md
            introduction-zh_cn.md
        mcdreforged.plugin.json
        requirements.txt
    readme.md
    LICENSE

Then the ``related_path`` would be ``source``

Type: str

.. note::

    It's highly recommend to keep your plugin's ``related_path`` field unchanged after the plugin is published,
    otherwise the plugin catalogue might not be able to locate and fetch the metadata of older releases of your plugin

labels
~~~~~~

Optional field, default: ``[]``

A list of id of :ref:`plugin_dev/plugin_catalogue:Label` of your plugin. Choose them wisely

Type: List[str]

introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Introduction is a paragraph written in markdown syntax, showing the features of the plugin to attract new users. It will be shown to user when they are browsing your plugin.

For the :ref:`plugin_dev/plugin_catalogue:introduction` field, it's a mapping maps :ref:`plugin_dev/plugin_catalogue:language` into a file path

The key is the language

The value is the file path of the introduction file in your plugin repository.
Field :ref:`plugin_dev/plugin_catalogue:related_path` is considered during the calculation of the real url

Example with the same file structure in :ref:`plugin_dev/plugin_catalogue:related_path`:

.. code-block:: json

    "introduction": {
        "en_us": "doc/introduction.md",
        "zh_cn": "doc/introduction-zh_cn.md"
    }

.. tip::

    A commonly-used and recommended practice is to link the introduction document to the README files in your repository

    .. code-block:: json

        "introduction": {
            "en_us": "README.md",
            "zh_cn": "README_CN.md"
        }

Alternatively, you can don't declare this field but put your introduction file inside the same directory where ``plugin_info.json`` is

It's named by ``introduction.md`` for default language ``en_us`` and named by e.g. ``introduction-zh_cn.md`` for other language

.. code-block::

    plugins/
     └─ my_plugin
         ├─ plugin_info.json
         ├─ introduction.md
         └─ introduction-zh_cn.md

You should provide the introduction at least in one language.

Type: Dict[str, str]

* English (``en_us``)
* Simplified Chinese (``zh_cn``)

The default and fallback language is ``en_us``

Release
-------

Plugin catalogue will automatically detect the releases in your plugin repository and extract the plugin download url in the assets, as long as the release follows the following restrictions:

* Pre-release: It should not be a pre-release
* Release tag name: **the same as the version of the released plugin**, can be in one of the following format

.. list-table::
    :header-rows: 1

    * - Format
      - Example
    * - ``<version>``
      - 1.2.3
    * - ``v<version>``
      - v1.2.3
    * - ``<plugin_id>-<version>``
      - my_plugin-1.2.3
    * - ``<plugin_id>-v<version>``
      - my_plugin-v1.2.3

* Assets: contains 1 asset with ``.mcdr`` or ``.pyz`` file extension name. Other assets will be ignored

  Which also means only :ref:`plugin_dev/plugin_format:Packed Plugin` is supported

Submit Plugin
-------------

It's encouraged to read the `Contributing Guidelines <http://https://github.com/MCDReforged/PluginCatalogue/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md>`_ before submitting your plugin

If you want to submit your plugin:

1. Fork the catalogue repo

2. Create a directory for your plugin within the ``plugins/`` folder, including all the necessary files

3. Make a pull request

It's recommended to leave your github link in the :ref:`plugin_dev/plugin_catalogue:authors` field so repository maintainers can simply tell if you are the owner of the plugin

All changes files should only be inside the sub-directory named by your plugin id in the ``plugins/`` folder
