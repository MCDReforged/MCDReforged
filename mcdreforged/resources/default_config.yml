# The configuration file for MCDReforged
# See the document https://docs.mcdreforged.com/en/latest/configuration.html for more details


# =========================================
# |          Basic Configuration          |
# =========================================


# The language that MCDR will use to display information
# Examples: "en_us", "zh_cn"
language: en_us


# =========================================
# |          Server Configuration         |
# =========================================


# The working directory of the server process
# For default value "server", It's suggested to put all the files related to the server into the server/ directory
working_directory: server


# The command to start the server, it can be a string or a list of string
# (shell mode) If it's a string, the command will be executed as a shell command in a shell environment
# (exec mode) If it's a list of strings, the command will be executed directly
# Example command for starting a Minecraft server:
#   'java -Xms1G -Xmx2G -jar minecraft_server.jar nogui'                        (shell mode)
#   ['java', '-Xms1G', '-Xmx2G', '-jar', 'minecraft_server.jar', 'nogui']       (exec mode)
start_command: echo Hello world from MCDReforged


# The handler to the specific way to parse the standard output text of the server and the correct command for server control
#   vanilla_handler    , for Vanilla / Carpet / Fabric server
#   beta18_handler     , for Vanilla server in legacy versions, e.g. < 1.7, or even beta1.8
#   bukkit_handler     , for Bukkit / Spigot server with Minecraft version below 1.14, and Paper / Mohist server in all version
#   bukkit14_handler   , for Bukkit / Spigot server with Minecraft version 1.14 and above
#   forge_handler      , for Forge server
#   cat_server_handler , for CatServer server
#   arclight_handler   , for Arclight server
#   bungeecord_handler , for Bungeecord server
#   waterfall_handler  , for Waterfall server
#   velocity_handler   , for Velocity server
handler: vanilla_handler


# The codec format to encode messages to stdin / decode messages from stdout of the server
# Leave it blank for MCDR to use the system encoding
# For vanilla Minecraft servers, you need to set "encoding" to utf8, since they always read stdin with UTF-8
# Examples: "utf8", "gbk"

# MCDR -> Server
encoding: utf8

# Server -> MCDR
decoding: utf8


# Minecraft RCON setting
# If enabled, plugins can use rcon to query commands from the server
rcon:
  enable: false
  address: 127.0.0.1
  port: 25575
  password: password


# =========================================
# |          Plugin Configuration         |

# The list of directory path where MCDR will search for plugins to load
# Example: "path/to/my/plugin/directory"

# The cache TTL of a fetched plugin catalogue meta
# MCDR will keep using the cached meta within its TTL for the following catalogue plugin operations
catalogue_meta_cache_ttl: 1200


# The timeout in seconds for a plugin catalogue meta fetch
catalogue_meta_fetch_timeout: 15


# Override the URL pointing to the "everything.json" or "everything_slim.json" file, which is used to fetch the plugin catalogue meta
# If it ends with ".gz" (gzip) or ".xz" (lzma), corresponding decompression operation will be applied
# If not provided, the url will be "https://api.mcdreforged.com/catalogue/everything_slim.json.xz"
catalogue_meta_url:


# Plugin file download override. Should be a valid python str.format string
# Available variables: {url}, {repos_owner}, {repos_name}, {tag}, {asset_name}, {asset_id}
# As an example, to use ghproxy, you can set it to: "https://mirror.ghproxy.com/{url}"
# If not provided, the origin GitHub asset download url will be directly used
plugin_download_url:


# The timeout in seconds for a plugin file download
plugin_download_timeout: 15


# Extra arguments passed to the pip subprocess for installing required python packages during plugin installation
# Example: "-i https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple"
